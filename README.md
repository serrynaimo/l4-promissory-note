# l4-promissory-note

A simple promissory note/debt contract written in L4 to demonstrate the capabilities of the L4 DSL.
It contains lots of comments explaining L4 and the concepts implemented. The reference PDF shows what a contract like this
might look like in real-life.

Playing with the tests is a great way to get started tinkering with the language.

You can copy the prelude, note and tests together into the same sheet in our [online-editor](https://jl4.legalese.com) to run it
or clone, build and run the [L4 IDE](https://github.com/smucclaw/l4-ide) and run this L4 code inside [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com).


## L4 - Rules-as-code

L4 is an open-source programming language designed by [Legalese](https://legalese.com) to author better
contracts, regulation and other rules so that humans and computers can read and evaluate them.
